###### Hardware build process
Building hardware to meet performance, usability, cost, and other goals is no easy task. For most devices and solutions, the process involves many phases and iterations.
- Brainstorm & Consult: Discuss your idea or project, identify the best technical solutions, and estimate costs and timelines.
- Project Planning: Turn your idea into a detailed plan, including device architecture, technical requirements, resource lists, and schedules.
- Project Management: Track progress and timelines to ensure everything stays organized and transparent for you.
- Research & Development (R&D): Evaluate technologies, develop hardware and software, and refine designs from prototypes to production-ready models.
- Manufacturing: Prepare designs for production (DFM), organize manufacturing, and scale from prototypes or small batches to mass production.
- Support: Guide you through development, production, and post-release stages to ensure success.
